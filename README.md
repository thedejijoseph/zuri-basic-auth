## Solution to ZuriTraining/PHP/Task-03

**Instructions**

From your knowledge of PHP forms and files, PHP loops, functions and sessions, create a basic authentication page that does the following:

- register (a new user can register, their details stored in a database file).
- login (checks in the file and logs them in if they are already registered)
- reset password
- logout

NOTE: Storing details in a Database file means that the data you get from your user inputs should be stored in a file (i.e you are to use a file as your database, as opposed to using query languages)

**Submission**

To submit this task;

- create a repository on your github profile
- push your work to this repository
- submit the link to your repo

You will be graded on these 4 features. You get 2 marks each for each feature that works. Extra 2 marks for your overall code, the process and procedure.

GOOD LUCK!!!
